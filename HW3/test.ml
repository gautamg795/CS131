(* A simple test harness for the MOCaml interpreter. *)

(* put your tests here:
   each test is a pair of a MOCaml declaration and the expected
   result:
     - the MOCaml declaration is a string of exactly what you would type into the interpreter prompt,
       without the trailing ";;"
     - the expected result is a string of exactly what you expect the interpreter to print as a result
   use the string "dynamic type error" as the result if a DynamicTypeError is expected to be raised.
   use the string "match failure" as the result if a MatchFailure is expected to be raised.
   use the string "implement me" as the result if an ImplementMe exception is expected to be raised

   call the function runtests() to run these tests
